This folder (clean-uniform) includes the main scripts and functions for running the uniform resolution analysis with arbitrarily generated fields.

The two main scripts to run are:
- "sim_discrete_fullres_wait_study_parallel.m"
- "sim_discrete_fullres_wait_study_nonparallel.m"

Each loops through and compiles results from multiple simulations. The parallel version leverages MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox using "parfor". If you do not have access to the toolbox, then use the 'nonparallel' version. 

The results are gathered and stores in a .mat file. The uniform resolution figures seen in the paper can be generated by the scripts in 'Data Analysis Scripts' folder.
